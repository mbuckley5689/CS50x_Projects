sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort should be the slowest sorting algorithm when sorting a reversed list;

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Merge sort should not be the slowest when sorting randomized data. Sort 1 is bubble sort. Because sort3
had the longest run time when sorting a random list, through process of elimination, sort 2 is implied to be merge sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Because sort1 is bubble sort and sort2 is merge sort, sort3 must be selection sort.
